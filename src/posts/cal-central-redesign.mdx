### Project Description
In UC Berkeleyâ€™s User Experience Design course, the assignment was to choose a website or app to redesign. 
As UC Berkeley students, my group and I are frequent users of the CalCentral website. We are often using 
this website to plan our schedule with the Schedule Planner feature, and to enroll for classes on Enrollment Center. 
Although this website is pivotal for any Cal student, 
its current format and design lacks intuitiveness and advancement. 
In this project, our group worked towards redesigning the website, 
and specifically the Enrollment Center and Schedule Planner tabs on CalCentral 
to help make it more optimal, accessible, and user-friendly.

### Design Challenge
Use the concepts learned from class to perform a critique of an existing experience, identify areas for improvement, 
and redesign the experience using the principles of visual and user experience design.

### Purpose
The Schedule Planner tab on CalCentral allows UC Berkeley students to plan their current and future schedules by adding 
prospective courses, and making sure that no time conflicts occur. This allows students to make more informed decisions 
about which courses to take and gives them a better idea about how their days will look like. The Enrollment Center tab on 
CalCentral allows users to view their current enrolled courses, view their Shopping Cart (saved courses), search for courses, 
and enroll in classes. These features allow students 
to make more informed decisions about the classes they would like to take.

### Product critique and solution
The current format and aesthetics of the Enrollment Center and Schedule Planner pages on the CalCentral website is not optimal. 
Specifically, it is often quite challenging for users to envision their future schedule with the lack of organization and 
aesthetics, and a plethora of unnecessary information presented on these pages. Additionally, users have a hard time searching for, 
viewing, and enrolling and adding courses to cart due to a disorganized visual hierarchy, the lack of organization and aesthetics, 
the absence of consistency, and an excess number of steps and clicks required to complete these tasks.

The original design (left side) emphasizes the vertical separation of filters, courses, current schedules, 
and shopping cart categories. The placement of these blocks of information hinders the user from doing the primary task of planning classes to enroll.
In the new design (right side), the task becomes the prominent guiding factor in improving both the visual appearance and efficiency of the workflow. 
The design reduces information overload by organizing information based on visual and functional hierarchy.
The two main processes (class search and schedule planner) are strategically placed in a large format top center location. The calendar format 
visibly dominates the page which makes the user interact with it immediately.

The original design (left side) allows the user to select several scheduled versions and compare them. If the user needs to compare different sets, 
the user needs to exit the overlaid page and re-select those versions.
The new design (right side) addresses the issue of disjointed workflow. selecting and exiting from a page adds unnecessary steps. With the new design, 
the user can easily choose the scheduled versions simply 
by activating each numbered version if the user wants to view it with other versions. 

Buttons and actions are in close proximity. Redesign the schedule comparison to be more simplified and easier to understand and 
reduce the back and forth from page to page and reduce the need to recall past class schedules by presenting relevant information in one view. 
The way the new design works, you can select/deselect any versions to make side-by-side comparisons. This will make it easier to visually 
inspect information with alternate scheduling options.
