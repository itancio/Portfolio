### Project Description

In UC Berkeley's User Experience Design course, my group and I undertook a project to revamp the CalCentral website, 
focusing on enhancing the user interface and functionality of the Schedule Planner and 
Enrollment Center features. We identified these areas as critical yet lacking in intuitiveness 
and modern design, which are essential for the website that plays a vital role in student life. 

Our goal was to improve the website's overall usability, accessibility, and efficiency.

### Purpose
The Schedule Planner tab on CalCentral enables UC Berkeley students to craft their academic schedules 
by adding potential courses and preventing scheduling conflicts, aiding in informed course selection. 

The Enrollment Center tab offers functionality to view enrolled courses, manage a Shopping Cart of saved courses, 
search for new courses, and enroll, facilitating informed decision-making regarding class choices.

### User Persona
![Thumbnail](/static/calcentral/calcentral_persona.png)
Oski the Bear, a lifelong UC Berkeley learner, faces challenges with the CalCentral website during his Summer 2023 course 
enrollment. Despite his experience with the site, he struggles to use the Schedule Planner due to its disorganized information 
and lacks the ability to sync schedules with Google Calendar. Additionally, he finds the Enrollment Center difficult to navigate, 
with issues such as the disappearing control panel during class searches and unnecessarily complex steps for adding classes to his cart 
or enrolling. Oski wishes for a more streamlined and less intimidating enrollment process on CalCentral.

### Journey Map

### Identifying user pain points
#### Enrollment Center
1. The process to enroll or add a course to the cart is cumbersome, 
requiring an excessive number of steps and clicks.
2. Once in the enrollment process, the sidebar becomes inaccessible, 
complicating the navigation between different sections.
3. Lacks a straightforward method to return to previous pages while searching for courses.
4. Inconsistent button placement throughout the enrollment process creates a confusing user experience.

#### Schedule Planner
1. Information is presented in a cluttered and disorganized way, with no clear visual hierarchy to guide the user.
2. There is no capability to export the schedule from the Schedule Planner to external calendars like Google Calendar or bCal.

### General product critique
The current format and aesthetics of the Enrollment Center and Schedule Planner pages on the CalCentral website is not optimal. 
Specifically, it is often quite challenging for users to envision their future schedule with the lack of organization and 
aesthetics, and a plethora of unnecessary information presented on these pages. Additionally, users have a hard time searching for, 
viewing, and enrolling and adding courses to cart due to a disorganized visual hierarchy, the lack of organization and aesthetics, 
the absence of consistency, and an excess number of steps and clicks required to complete these tasks.

### Our Redesign Walkthrough

#### A. CalCentral Sign in

![Thumbnail](/static/calcentral/calcentral_login2.png)
The original design (left side) has an overabundance of whitespace due to a light background image, 
particularly at the top, giving an impression of emptiness. 
- The more important lower portion of the image is mostly cropped out, diminishing its impact. 
- The page's background is unimaginative and dull in color, contributing to a monotonous and uninviting aesthetic 
that could deter users from engaging with the website.

With the new design (right side), the color palette is cohesive and aligns with the University of California, Berkeleyâ€™s branding. 
- Colors: The blue and gold are a classic combination that represents the university's colors well. The typography is clear and easy to read.
- Typography: The font choice is professional and suitable for an educational institution. The layout is simple and straightforward, 
focusing on the essential elements like the CalNet ID and passphrase input fields. The use of the Berkeley logo and 
name at the top left corner makes it clear that this is an official university page.
- Illustration: The illustration of the Sather Tower (Campanile) is a nice touch that adds a unique and recognizable element 
related to the UC Berkeley campus.

#### B. CalCentral "My Academics" tab
![Thumbnail](/static/calcentral/calcentral_dashboard_old.png)
In the "My Academics" tab of the original design, applying the principle of proximity could have been more effective, 
particularly in the "Class Enrollment" section. Here, interpreting enrollment times and dates is a challenge, 
mainly due to the insufficient visual hierarchy and spacing amidst words and dates. This makes it challenging to ascertain 
which pieces of information correlate and which are independent, causing potential confusion and mistakes.

Enhancing the readability in this section is essential. A clearer separation of related information and effective utilization 
of spacing could help users quickly comprehend the enrollment times and dates, reducing the likelihood of errors or misunderstandings.

Furthermore, the principle of similarity could be better leveraged to distinctly separate different groups, such as "Phase 1" 
and "Phase 2". Presently, these groups appear nearly identical, making it hard to differentiate between them, 
increasing the chances of users referencing incorrect information inadvertently. Improvements in this area could include 
using varied colors or typography to make each phase visually distinct, guiding users more accurately through the information.

In this new design, we addressed the following design elements:
- Consistency: The design maintains a consistent use of colors, typography, and layout across different sections 
which helps in creating a cohesive user experience.
- Organization: Information is organized into clear sections such as Academic Profile, Semesters, Status & Holds, etc., 
which makes it easier to find specific information.
- Use of Icons: Icons are used effectively next to different sections like Status & Holds, Degree Requirements, etc., 
making it visually easier to identify different categories.
- Color Coding: Different colors are used for different statuses like "On track", "Not started", 
which helps in quickly identifying the status of different requirements.
- Interactive Elements: The page includes interactive elements like drop-down menus and links 
which can make the user experience more engaging and efficient.


#### C. Class search

#### D. Schedule Planner
![Thumbnail](/static/calcentral/calcentral_planner1.png)
The original design (left side) emphasizes the vertical separation of filters, courses, current schedules, 
and shopping cart categories. The placement of these blocks of information hinders the user from doing the primary task of planning classes to enroll.
In the new design (right side), the task becomes the prominent guiding factor in improving both the visual appearance and efficiency of the workflow. 
The design reduces information overload by organizing information based on visual and functional hierarchy.
The two main processes (class search and schedule planner) are strategically placed in a large format top center location. The calendar format 
visibly dominates the page which makes the user interact with it immediately.

![Thumbnail](/static/calcentral/calcentral_planner2.png)
The original design (left side) allows the user to select several scheduled versions and compare them. If the user needs to compare different sets, 
the user needs to exit the overlaid page and re-select those versions.
The new design (right side) addresses the issue of disjointed workflow. selecting and exiting from a page adds unnecessary steps. With the new design, 
the user can easily choose the scheduled versions simply 
by activating each numbered version if the user wants to view it with other versions. 

Buttons and actions are in close proximity. Redesign the schedule comparison to be more simplified and easier to understand and 
reduce the back and forth from page to page and reduce the need to recall past class schedules by presenting relevant information in one view. 
The way the new design works, you can select/deselect any versions to make side-by-side comparisons. This will make it easier to visually 
inspect information with alternate scheduling options.
