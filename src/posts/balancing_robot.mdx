title: 'Balancing Robot'
abstract: ' This bi-wheeled robot resembles an inverted pendulum with self correcting
            stability measurements. The motivation for this project is to get experience 
            with building system from schematics and to learn how the feedback loop model 
            makes motor adjustments from the input measurements of the accelerator-gyroscope module.'
